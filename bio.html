                  I studied art history and archeology at Uiversité Libre de Bruxelles. Mainly civilizations without scriptures. I really liked archeology for the practical side and the thinking, but much less the history of art where most of the work was "simply" learning by heart.

                    I got interested in programming a year ago while taking a course about new technology. I discovered all that programming could bring. I start to learn a little bit of Python on my own. But learning by yourself is hard and I didn't always know how to hang on when my work took all my mental energy.

                    I am currently team leader at the Federal Pensions Service. I manage a team that deals with the conditions of pension payments (administrative work). I have been working at SFP since 2014.

                    Since I am kid, I have always been interested by science and technology. I am particularly interested in the reasoning behind each program. I like to think and find solutions. It's fascinating to have to learn everything and to be able to constantly evolve. All these things are not brought to me to my current job.
